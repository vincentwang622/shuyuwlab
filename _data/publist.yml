- title: "Microfabrication of plastic-PDMS microfluidic devices using polyimide release layer and selective adhesive bonding"
  image: SEM.png
  description: In this paper, we present an improved method to bond poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with polyimide (PI) to develop flexible substrate microfluidic devices. This proposed versatile method could bond the microfluidic device and plastic substrate together and be applied in the fabrication of some biosensors and lab-on-a-chip systems.
